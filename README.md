## Backlog
âš  US #1 As a Tic-Tac-Toe game spectator I want to have a blank starting board drawn so that I can enjoy the game visually.
 âš  Scenario #1 Given a Tic-Tac-Toe game simulator When I start a new game Then the game should appear in a 3x3 board.

âš  US #2 As a Tic-Tac-Toe game spectator I want player 'X' to move first so that I can verify that the game has started.
 âš  Scenario #1 Given a Tic-Tac-Toe game simulator When 'X' marks the 1st cell as it's first move Then the board should show the following stance: (X, , , , , , , , ).
 âš  Scenario #2 Given a Tic-Tac-Toe game simulator When 'X' marks the 2nd cell as it's first move Then the board should show the following stance: ( ,X, , , , , , , ).
